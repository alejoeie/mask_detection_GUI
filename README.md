# Welcome to Mask Detection GUI App
Due to COVID-19 global affectations, and due to the entire lifestyle change, I decided to build a program able to 
predict a facial mask. This could be applied in banks, markets, public transport (it detects multiple faces at once), or even in your
own business for protecting you and others against COVID-19.
## Requirements
For this you need to previously install:
```
tensorflow
numpy
imutils
openCV
matplotlib
tkinter
```

To install it, you could use:

`pip3 install tensorflow`
`pip3 install numpy`
`pip3 install imutils`
`pip3 install opencv-python`
`pip3 install matplotlib`
`pip3 install tkinter`

***Note: Commands may vary depending on your python version, so I suggest you to use python3 to avoid any kind of problems. If you
use anaconda environments, you should go ahead and search for these installing commands in order to make it work.***

### References
Some of the resources used to achieve this program were thanks to ```@github/balajisrinivas @sentdex @Jose Portilla from Udemy Academy```

Without these three people it would not be possible to understand and perform machine learning using python.
